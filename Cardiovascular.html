  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The human body comprises a diverse array of cells that collectively form tissues and organ systems. At the heart of this intricate network is the cardiovascular system, which is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body and sustaining life. My analysis focuses on patients admitted to the hospital with cardiovascular diseases, a leading cause of mortality globally.</p>
  <p>An analysis of the top five leading causes of death in Canada from 2017 to 2021 reveals that heart-related diseases consistently rank among the most significant contributors, occupying the second and fourth positions for the majority of the years.</p>

  <p>We tried to identify the following from our analysis</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Observing patients admitted to the hospital with diverse cardiovascular diseases.</li>
  <li>Analyzing the underlying conditions associated with the patient such as heart failure, acute kidney disease.</li>
  <li>Analyzing the outcome of the patient for the duration of hospital admission.</li>
</ul>
  <p>We have selected two datasets from Kaggle and described them in the next section.</p>
  <h1>Datasets Utilized</h1>
  <p>We have utilized the “Hospital Admissions Data” dataset (File size: 2.6 MB, Rows: 15757 K, Columns: 56) available in the Kaggle portal <span style="color: blue;">(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishsahani/hospital-admissions-data/discussion/302894?resource=download&select=HDHI+Admission+data.csv)</span>in CSV format.</p>
  <p>The Kaggle portal provides this dataset free of charge and can be used for research/project purposes. Details of their conditions are available in <span style="color: blue;">https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics12020241</span>. This dataset is being provided under creative commons License (Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)) <span style="color: blue;">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/.</span></p>
  <p>This data was collected from patients admitted over a period of two years (1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019) at Hero DMC Heart Institute, Unit of Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, Punjab, India. During the study period, the cardiology unit had 14,845 admissions corresponding to 12,238 patients. 1921 patients who had multiple admissions.</p>

  <h1>Description of Important Variables</h1>
  <p>As discussed previously, the initial dataset included a variety of variables.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>For qualitative variables, we counted the occurrences of the value '1'. If the count was below 1,000, we excluded the variable due to its relatively small contribution to the overall dataset.</li>
  <li>Most quantitative variables were retained, except for BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide), which had 10,000 missing entries. Additionally, Serial No. and MRD No. were excluded due to their lack of relevance to the analysis.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The key variables used in this project (as identified by certain models) are listed below.</p>
  <p>The primary variables analyzed in this project were HEART.FAILURE, AKI(Acute Kidney Injury), OUTCOME, and DURATION.OF.STAY.</p>
