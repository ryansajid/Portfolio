  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The human body comprises a diverse array of cells that collectively form tissues and organ systems. At the heart of this intricate network is the cardiovascular system, which is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body and sustaining life. My analysis focuses on patients admitted to the hospital with cardiovascular diseases, a leading cause of mortality globally.</p>
  <p>An analysis of the top five leading causes of death in Canada from 2017 to 2021 reveals that heart-related diseases consistently rank among the most significant contributors, occupying the second and fourth positions for the majority of the years.</p>

  <p>We tried to identify the following from our analysis</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Observing patients admitted to the hospital with diverse cardiovascular diseases.</li>
  <li>Analyzing the underlying conditions associated with the patient such as heart failure, acute kidney disease.</li>
  <li>Analyzing the outcome of the patient for the duration of hospital admission.</li>
</ul>
  <p>We have selected two datasets from Kaggle and described them in the next section.</p>
